                    Conservation Corps, helping starving Americans. "I saw how food changed <br>

               <li><b>1937</b>- Finishes university and takes a job in the US Forestry Service</li><br>

                         Stakman, who teaches him about breeding pest-resistent plants.</li><br>
                <li><b>1941</b>- Tries to enroll in the military after the Pearl Harbor attack, but is<br>
                            rejected. Instead, the military asked his lab to work on waterproof glue, DDT<br>
                             to control malaria, disinfectants, and other applied science.</li><br>
                <li><b>1942</b>- Receives a Ph.D. in Genetics and Plant Pathology</li><br>
                <li><b>1944</b>- Rejects a 100% salary increase from Dupont, leaves behind his<br>
                                pregnant wife, and flies to Mexico to head a new plant pathology program.<br>
                                 Over the next 16 years, his team breeds 6,000 different strains of disease<br>
                                  resistent wheat - including different varieties for each major climate on Earth.</li><br>
                <li><b>1945</b>- Discovers a way to grown wheat twice each season, doubling wheat <br>yields</li><br>
                <li><b>1953</b>- Crosses a short, sturdy dwarf breed of wheat with a high-yeidling<br>
                                    American breed, creating a strain that responds well to fertilizer. It goes on<br> to provide 95% of Mexico's wheat.</li><br>
                <li><b>1962</b>- Visits Delhi and brings his high-yielding strains of wheat to the Indian<br>
                                        subcontinent in time to help mitigate mass starvation due to a rapidly<br> expanding population</li><br>
                <li><b>1970</b>- Receives the Nobel Peace Prize</li><br>
                <li><b>1983</b>- Helps seven African countries dramatically increase their maize and <br>sorghum yields</li><br>

                <li><b>2005</b>- States "we will have to double the world food supply by 2050." Argues<br>
                                            that genetically modified crops are the only way we can meet the demand, as<br> we run out of arable land. Says that GM crops are not inherently dangerous<br>
                                             because "we've been genetically modifying plants and animals for a long<br> time. Long before we called it science, people were selecting the best breeds."</li><br>
                <li><b>2009</b>- Dies at the age of 95.</li><br>
